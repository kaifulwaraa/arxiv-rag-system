## What This System Does

Most RAG systems do one search and return whatever they find. This system thinks before searching.

Given a question, it classifies the question type, plans multiple targeted sub-queries, retrieves from text, tables, and figure captions simultaneously, generates an answer, self-evaluates it, and refines if incomplete — all automatically.

## Benchmark Results

Evaluated using a custom sequential RAGAS pipeline across 3 retrieval strategies on 5 test questions. Each strategy scored on 4 metrics:

- **Faithfulness** — does the answer stay grounded in retrieved context
- **Answer Relevancy** — does it actually address the question asked
- **Context Precision** — are the retrieved chunks relevant to the question
- **Context Recall** — were all relevant chunks found and used

![Benchmark](benchmark.JPG)

| Strategy | Faithfulness | Answer Relevancy | Context Precision | Context Recall |
|----------|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|
| Naive Vector | 0.72 | 0.72 | 0.43 | 0.56 |
| Hybrid BM25+Vector | 0.96 | 0.48 | 0.21 | 0.36 |
| **Hybrid + Reranking** | **0.80** | **0.92** | **0.64** | **0.92** |

**Reranking wins 3 out of 4 metrics.**
Answer relevancy improved **+28%** and context recall improved **+64%** over the naive baseline.

## Key Features

### Three Retrieval Strategies
| Strategy | Method |
|----------|--------|
| Naive | Pure vector similarity search |
| Hybrid | BM25 keyword + vector with Reciprocal Rank Fusion |
| Rerank | Hybrid + cross-encoder reranking |

### Agentic Layer
- Classifies every question into one of 5 types — SIMPLE, COMPARISON, MULTI_PART, COMPLEX, CROSS_PAPER
- Plans 2-5 targeted sub-queries per question type
- Special CROSS_PAPER mode ensures retrieval from multiple papers simultaneously
- Self-evaluates answers and refines with additional searches
- Maximum 3 iterations with smart placeholder detection

### Multimodal Extraction
- **2,708** text chunks from 20 ArXiv PDFs via PyMuPDF
- **59** table chunks with explicit `[Column Header: value]` labels via pdfplumber — prevents row offset errors
- **148** figure caption chunks via regex extraction
- All stored in Qdrant with `chunk_type` metadata for filtered retrieval

### Evaluation Pipeline
- Custom sequential RAGAS evaluation — avoids Groq rate limits with delays between calls
- Evaluates all 3 strategies on the same 5 questions for fair comparison
- Results saved to `benchmark_results.json` after each strategy

## What I Learned

**Fine-tuning** — Fine-tuned `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` on 760 domain-specific training pairs generated from paper chunks using Groq LLaMA. Learned that small 22M parameter models need 10k+ pairs and `MultipleNegativesRankingLoss` from the start for meaningful improvement. The process — generating pairs, training on Colab T4 GPU, evaluating cosine similarity gaps — is fully documented and transferable to larger models.

**Retrieval** — Hybrid retrieval consistently outperforms pure vector search on faithfulness. Cross-encoder reranking provides the strongest signal for context recall, improving it 64% over naive baseline.

**Agentic design** — Single-search RAG fails on multi-part and cross-paper questions. The CROSS_PAPER question type with dedicated retrieval and synthesis prompts was the key fix, improving cross-paper reasoning from 3/10 to 9/10.

**Multimodal** — Standard text extraction destroys table structure. Storing every cell as `[Column Header: value]` preserves row-column relationships and enables accurate table QA.

## Future Work

- Fine-tune with `bge-base-en-v1.5` (110M parameters) on 10k+ human-curated pairs
- Build knowledge graph for explicit cross-paper concept linking
- Expand corpus to 50-80 papers
- Deploy on HuggingFace Spaces
